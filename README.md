# Crowd-Estimation_Intern
This is a module named Crowd Estimation for IVR project done during internship. 

This module is developed to detect and count the number of people present and then, display the output in web page. This module can be customized based on user requirements and needs. 
The concept of this module is that, when it detects a person walking from any area named Point A and Point B, which are separated by a horizontal line, it will calculate the number of people coming in and out from the areas, in real-time.  This algorithm/logic of the module is developed based on the top view. 
This module is developed by using Machine Learning library supported by Python which is OpenCV. OpenCV is used commonly for object detection. On the web page, the output that will be displayed are the real-time video stream, the number of people coming in and out, and the time of detection. This module also applies Pusher, which is a hosted service used to add real-time data and functionality to web and mobile applications. Crowd Estimation module is also using a database engine named SQLite3 to store its data inside the database.
